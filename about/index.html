    <h1>Sōki Onoe / 0n0e.</h1>
    <p>
      I create interactive works with the theme of my upbringing. From the time I became aware of the world, I’ve longed for places that were not here, but the places that existed beyond the screen or inside a frame, unreachable in reality. Having been exposed to the internet from a young age, I may have tried to disconnect from reality by immersing myself in places that didn’t exist, neglecting the things around me.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no clear reason for my longing, but reflecting on it now, I think I have been influenced by the atmosphere of my family and society. Both of my parents graduated from art schools and have been creating art ever since. I grew up hearing things like, “Even if we’re poor, we should make something that will last,” or “This work will be passed down through generations.” The praise I received during my childhood was almost always related to art, and the most significant education I received from my parents was also in the field of art. I didn’t have a strong will or clear sense of direction, and I was easily swayed. During my rebellious years, I even considered pursuing a path outside of art, but ultimately, I entered university to develop the artistic sensibilities I had absorbed from the environment I grew up in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during this time that I began to develop a fondness for what is now called the "Sekai-kei" genre, a particularly popular genre of anime and manga in the 1990s. These works often featured protagonists who, despite being seemingly powerless, grew and ultimately ended up with a girl. As I have felt myself to be powerless, I clung to these stories until I have become who I am today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps because of this, I came to like characters who are hard to define or whose interpretations are open-ended—often young girls who possess qualities of ambiguity. I frequently incorporate avatars with such qualities in my works. One of my past projects was titled <em>Brutalism and Two Other Pieces</em>, in which there is an avatar that represents me, who wanders through each of them, and poems written in line with the concept I gave to each world are displayed on the screen. In this work, it appears that the avatar is reciting poetry, but virtually, it is me who is presenting the poems through the avatar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now, I still feel a deep yearning to go somewhere else. Today, art is not limited to painting; many forms and methods have been established, and video games are also considered one of them. Given my era and my personality, I’ve often engaged with games and computers, which led me to choose characters and digital devices as the media for my work. Fortunately to me, these media also have the property of revealing places that do not exist. At this point in my journey, I want to create works that invite audiences to step outside the framework of reality, drawing them in as participants in the otherworldly experience.
